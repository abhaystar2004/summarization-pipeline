This is not the place for:

generic ethereum discussion.  For that visit r/ethereum.
discussing specific EIPs.  For that visit the Ethereum Magicians forum.
technical questions and ELI5s. For that visit the StackExchange.

Forum Features!
1. LaTeX Equations
This forum supports \LaTeX equations between $dollar signs$.  The default LaTeX style is the “inline” style which looks like \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} = 2^n , in text this is
$ \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} = 2^n $

However, if you start your equation with $$ on it’s own beginning and teminating line like,
$$
\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} = 2^n
$$

it looks like this

\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} = 2^n


2. Graphviz diagrams
See the documentation for a list of examples to build your graph.
[graphviz engine=dot]
digraph {
  concentrate=true;
  a[color=red, style=filled, fillcolor=pink];
  b[shape=diamond];
  a -> b;
  b -> c;
  c -> a;
  d -> c;
  e -> c;
  e -> a;
  a -> e;
}
[/graphviz]






a

a



b

b



a->b





e

e



a->e






c

c



b->c





c->a





d

d



d->c





e->c






3. YUML diagrams
YUML diagrams allow making nice little graphs within your posts.
They have an idiosyncratic but fairly simple markup language.
Example:

[yuml]
[foo{bg:cornsilk}]--[baz]
[foo]->[bar{bg:orange}]
[baz]-.->[qux]
[qux]--label>[bar]
[/yuml]


[yuml]
[Vote Message|+Source hash;-Source height;+Target hash;-Target height|+Withdraw();+Last_commit]
[/yuml]


4. Images!
Unsurprisingly, we also support images.
